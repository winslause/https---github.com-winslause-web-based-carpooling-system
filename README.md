This is a web-based carpooling system. The project is designed to help people find rides, especially those working in towns. if someone has a car and is traveling along your route, he will post it then interested users can book seats. 
As of now, the cost of fuel is too high, the system will help people get to work at less cost while reducing traffic congestion on roads.
